# Jupyter Notebook

I am now using Jupyter Lab instead of Jupyter Notebook.  It seems better somehow for a few different reasons.  I also see a potential to try to combine discrete mathematics with python in the fall.  Maybe, I could somehow show in parallel the mathematical notation with the equivalent in python.

* A nice way to share Jupyter Notebooks is to use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org).  One can just enter the GitHub website for the Jupyter Notebook on this website and it renders the notebook nicely.
